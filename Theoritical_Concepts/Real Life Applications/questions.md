### 3. Undo/Redo Operations in a Text Editor
A text editor allows you to undo and redo your last few actions. Which data structure would you use to implement this functionality?

### 4. Hospital Patient Management
A hospital handles patient registrations. Patients arrive and are treated on a first-come, first-served basis. Which data structure can be used to simulate this process?

### 7. Recursive Function in Calculating Factorial
Suppose you're calculating the factorial of a number. How would you use recursion to solve this, and why might recursion be better than using an iterative approach?

### 8. Image Processing
When editing a digital image, each pixel can be represented as a position in a matrix of color values. Which data structure is most suitable for storing and manipulating the image?

### 9. Browser Tab Management
Imagine a scenario where each tab in a web browser can have multiple tabs opened within it (like a tree structure). What data structure would best represent this kind of hierarchy?

### 10. Document Word Processing
While typing in a document, you might want to go back to a previous paragraph to make edits. How would a doubly linked list help you efficiently navigate and edit a large document?

In an operating system, file directories are nested within each other. Which data structure can be used to represent and navigate through the directory structure?

### 13. Parking Lot Management
In a parking lot, cars are parked and removed in a specific order. Which data structure would you use to model this parking system, where the first car in can only leave after the cars parked behind it have left?

### 14. Text Autocomplete Feature
In a text editor, users receive word suggestions based on the first few letters they type. Which data structure can be used to store and retrieve word suggestions efficiently?

### 15. Expression Evaluation (Calculator)
You need to build a basic calculator that evaluates mathematical expressions like `(2 + 3) * 4`. Which data structure(s) would you use to handle operator precedence and evaluate the expression?

### 16. Customer Order Processing in a Restaurant
In a restaurant, customer orders are processed in the order they are placed, but certain high-priority orders (like rush orders) need to be processed immediately. Which data structures would best model this situation?
