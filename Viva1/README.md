# Viva Format

### 1. Contest Question Analysis (2 marks)

- Select any contest question where the student was unable to solve or solved it only partially.
- Ask the student what went wrong and have them explain their approach.
- Discuss the correct logic or changes they should make to solve the problem.
- **Marks:** Verbal explanation - 2 marks.

### 2. Time Complexity (1 mark)

- Provide a code snippet and ask the student to explain its time complexity.
- The explanation should include proper reasoning and logic.
- **Marks:** Verbal explanation - 1 mark.

### 3. Postfix/Prefix Evaluation (1 mark)

- Give a postfix or prefix expression and ask the student to evaluate it.
- **Marks:** 1 mark for the correct answer.

### 4. Real-world Application (2 mark)

- Present a real-world application and ask the student which Data Structures, that they've learned, can be applied to solve the problem.
- Ask them what problems might arise if the 'X' Data Structure is used instead of the one they answered.
- This is an open-ended question and allows for discussion.
- Students should provide a logical explanation, they should know differences between the data structures.
- **Marks:** Verbal explanation - 2 mark.

## Types of Live Programming Questions (4 marks)

You may choose any one of the following types of questions for live programming:

1. **Find the Error:**

   - Provide a code with some errors (syntax, logic, missing edge cases, etc.).
   - Ask the student to find and correct the errors.
   - **Marks:** 4 marks.

2. **Complete the Code:**

   - Explain the desired functionality and give the student an incomplete code.
   - Ask them to complete it.
   - **Marks:** 4 marks.

3. **Write Code from Scratch:**

   - Ask the student to write code from scratch, especially if they scored '0' in the contest.
   - Avoid this if they have recently solved the problem.
   - **Marks:** 4 marks.

4. **Understanding Code Logic:**
   - Ask the student to explain the logic of the code line by line.
   - You can also ask them to dry-run the code on a test case.
   - **Marks:** 4 marks.

- Ask about their participation in online coding platforms like Codeforces, CodeChef, etc.
- Ask if they have any questions for you.
